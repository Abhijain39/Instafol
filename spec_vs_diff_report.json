  "summary": "Diff makes broad frontend routing/layout/content changes and replaces backend actor with a Hello World query, but does not provide clear evidence of addressing a specific production deployment failure root cause or ensuring all required routes and simulator behavior remain intact. There is also an apparent route mismatch for Privacy Policy between the router and navigation links.",

      "requirement": "Resolve the production deployment error so the app can be successfully deployed, then perform a fresh production deployment retry. Identify the root cause and apply minimal changes so deployment succeeds without changing existing app behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows extensive UI/page content and routing refactors plus a backend replacement, but it does not show any concrete change directly tied to a diagnosed deployment failure (e.g., canister config/build fixes). Also, a route mismatch suggests existing routes may not render as required.",

      "reason": "Privacy Policy route is registered as \"/privacy-policy\" in App.tsx, but SiteLayout navigation links to \"/privacy\". This likely breaks navigation to the required Privacy Policy route.",
